This project was made for my girlfriend who is a first grade teacher, the idea was that she can take her students' 3 test grades from throughout the year and utilize them to calculate averages. 
Some things that this program calculates are things such as calculating the classes average growth, the classes average scores, and a list that organizes students by growth percentage.
